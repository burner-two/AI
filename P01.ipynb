    "# Concept Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Graph Traversal\n",
    "- **Graph traversal** is the process of visiting all the nodes (or vertices) in a graph. This is fundamental for many algorithms in computer science, particularly those that deal with searching and pathfinding.\n",
    "- Two common methods for graph traversal are:\n",
    "  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure.\n",
    "  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. This can be implemented iteratively or recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Search Algorithms\n",
    "- **BFS** is used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs. \n",
    "- **DFS** (and its iterative version, IDDFS) is useful for exploring all possible paths and is particularly good when the solution is far from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "# File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`dict_gn` (Graph Representation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure:\n",
    "`dict_gn` is a dictionary that represents a weighted graph using an adjacency list. Each key in this dictionary is a city, and the corresponding value is another dictionary representing neighboring cities and the distances (or weights) to those neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Here’s a simplified view of part of `dict_gn`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dict_gn = {\n",
    "    'Arad': {'Zerind': 75, 'Timisoara': 118, 'Sibiu': 140},\n",
    "    'Zerind': {'Oradea': 71, 'Arad': 75},\n",
    "    'Sibiu': {'Rimnicu': 80, 'Fagaras': 99, 'Arad': 140, 'Oradea': 151},\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Keys**: The keys are the names of cities (e.g., `'Arad'`, `'Zerind'`, etc.).\n",
    "- **Values**: Each key maps to another dictionary:\n",
    "  - The keys of this inner dictionary are neighboring cities (e.g., `'Zerind'`, `'Timisoara'` for `Arad`).\n",
    "  - The values are the distances to those neighboring cities. For example, from `Arad` to `Zerind`, the distance is `75`, and from `Arad` to `Timisoara`, the distance is `118`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- This structure allows for easy traversal of the graph. It facilitates algorithms like BFS and DFS by enabling quick access to neighboring nodes and their distances.\n",
    "- It provides the information needed to calculate paths and distances between cities in route-finding or pathfinding applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`dict_hn` (Heuristic Values)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure:\n",
    "`dict_hn` is a dictionary that represents heuristic values for each city. These values can be used in search algorithms like A* or for estimating the cost to reach the goal city.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Here’s the structure of `dict_hn`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dict_hn = {\n",
    "    'Arad': 336,\n",
    "    'Bucharest': 0,\n",
    "    'Craiova': 160,\n",
    "    'Dobreta': 242,\n",
    "    'Eforie': 161,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Keys**: The keys are the names of cities (similar to `dict_gn`).\n",
    "- **Values**: Each key maps to a numeric heuristic value, representing an estimated cost or distance from that city to the goal city (in this case, likely Bucharest).\n",
    "  - For example, the heuristic value for `Arad` is `336`, which means that the estimated cost to reach `Bucharest` from `Arad` is `336`.\n",
    "  - The value for `Bucharest` is `0` because it is the goal city, so no distance is required to reach itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Heuristic values help in guiding search algorithms towards the goal efficiently. They can be particularly useful in algorithms that require an estimate of distance or cost, such as A*.\n",
    "- In the context of the example, the heuristic values give a rough estimate of how far each city is from Bucharest, allowing the algorithm to prioritize which cities to explore first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Depth Limited Search (DLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-Limited Search (DLS) is a variant of the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. It introduces a limitation on the depth of the search, preventing the algorithm from exploring paths beyond a certain depth. This can be particularly useful in situations where the search space is large, or where you want to avoid going too deep into certain paths that are unlikely to lead to a solution. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Depth-Limited Search (DLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Strategy**:\n",
    "   - DLS explores a tree or graph by starting at the root node and moving downwards, following one branch until it either finds the goal or reaches the specified depth limit.\n",
    "   - If the depth limit is reached and the goal has not been found, the algorithm backtracks and explores other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depth Limit**:\n",
    "   - The depth limit is defined as a maximum number of edges (or levels) that can be traversed from the starting node.\n",
    "   - This limit helps prevent infinite loops in cases where cycles are present in the graph and restricts the search to a manageable portion of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Goal Condition**:\n",
    "   - As in any search algorithm, DLS checks whether the current node is the goal.\n",
    "   - If the goal is found within the depth limit, the search is successful, and the algorithm can return the path taken to reach the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visited Nodes**:\n",
    "   - DLS maintains a list (or stack) of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them, preventing infinite loops and reducing the time complexity in scenarios with cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - If the algorithm reaches the depth limit without finding the goal, it backtracks to the previous node and explores other unvisited branches.\n",
    "   - This process continues until all possible paths within the depth limit are exhausted.\n"
